  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                | margin calculator                  | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | oracle config          |
      | ETH/DEC19 | ETH        | ETH   | default-simple-risk-model | default-overkill-margin-calculator | 1                | default-none | default-none     | default-eth-for-future |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | market.auction.minimumDuration |
      | 1                              |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value   |
      | prices.ETH.value | 9400000 |
    And the traders make the following deposits on asset's general account:
      | trader     | asset | amount       |
      | trader1    | ETH   | 980000000    |
      | sellSideMM | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | buySideMM  | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | aux        | ETH   | 1000000000   |
      | aux2       | ETH   | 1000000000   |
    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type        | tif     |
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      |  6999999 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC |
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 50000001 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC |
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 10300000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
      | aux2    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 10300000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
    Then the opening auction period for market "ETH/DEC19" ends
    And the trading mode for the market "ETH/DEC19" is "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS"
    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC19" is "10300000"

    # setting mark price
    And traders place the following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 10300000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |

    # setting order book
    And traders place the following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 10     | 15000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell1     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 14     | 14000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell2     |

  Scenario:
    # no margin account created for trader1, just general account
    And "trader1" has only one account per asset
    # placing test order
    When traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price   | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 13     | 9000000 | 3                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
    And "trader1" general account for asset "ETH" balance is "698400040"
    And executed trades:
      | buyer     | price    | size | seller  |
      | buySideMM | 10000000 | 1    | trader1 |
      | buySideMM | 9600000  | 3    | trader1 |
      | buySideMM | 9000000  | 9    | trader1 |
    Then the following transfers happened:
      | from   | to      | from account            | to account          | market id | amount  | asset |
      | market | trader1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN | ETH/DEC19 | 2800000 | ETH   |

    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin    | general   |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 284399960 | 698400040 |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release   |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | 71099990    | 227519968 | 284399960 | 355499950 |
    And traders have the following profit and loss:
      | trader  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | trader1 | -13    | 2800000        | 0            |

    # NEW ORDERS ADDED WITHOUT ANOTHER TRADE HAPPENING
    Then traders cancel the following orders:
      | trader     | reference |
      | buySideMM  | buy4      |
      | sellSideMM | sell2     |
      | sellSideMM | sell3     |
