Feature: Trader below initial margin, but above maintenance can submit an order to close their own position

  Background:
    Given the markets start on "2020-10-16T00:00:00Z" and expire on "2020-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | quote name | asset | risk model | lamd/long | tau/short | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | auction duration | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading | oracle spec pub. keys | oracle spec property | oracle spec property type | oracle spec binding |
      | ETH/DEC20 | ETH        | ETH   | simple     | 0.11      | 0.1       | 0              | 0               | 0     | 1.4            | 1.2            | 1.1           | 1                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 1                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              | 0xDEADBEEF,0xCAFEDOOD | prices.ETH.value     | TYPE_INTEGER              | prices.ETH.value    |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | market.auction.minimumDuration |
      | 1                              |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |

  Scenario: Trader under initial margin closes out their own position
    Given the traders make the following deposits on asset's general account:
      | trader    | asset | amount         |
      | trader1   | ETH   | 10000000000000 |
      | trader2   | ETH   | 10000000000000 |
      | trader3   | ETH   | 1220           |
      | trader4   | ETH   | 10000000000000 |
      | trader5   | ETH   | 10000000000000 |
      | auxiliary | ETH   | 100000000000   |
      | aux2      | ETH   | 100000000000   |

    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then traders place the following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type        | tif     | 
      | auxiliary  | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 1      | 1        | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
      | auxiliary  | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 1      | 200      | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
      | aux2       | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 1      | 100      | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
      | auxiliary  | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 1      | 100      | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
    Then the opening auction period for market "ETH/DEC20" ends
    And the trading mode for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS"
    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "100"

    # T0 + 1min - this causes the price for comparison of the bounds to be 567
    Then time is updated to "2020-10-16T00:01:00Z"

    When traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif      | reference |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 10     | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC  | ref-1     |

    When traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader5 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 10     | 100   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_FOK | ref-1     |
      | trader4 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 10     | 110   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-2     |
      | trader4 | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 10     | 120   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-3     |

    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin | general       |
      | trader4 | ETH   | ETH/DEC20 | 133    | 9999999999867 |
      | trader5 | ETH   | ETH/DEC20 | 1320   | 9999999998680 |
      | trader3 | ETH   | ETH/DEC20 | 1220   | 0             |
    And clear order events
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 1100        | 1210   | 1320    | 1540    |

    ## Now trader 3, though below initial margin places a buy order to close their position out
    When traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader5 | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 20     | 115   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-6     |
      | trader4 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 15     | 115   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-7     |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 10     | 115   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-8     |
    ## The trades have happened, trader 3 bought 5 -> margin requirements go down
    Then the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "115"
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 83          | 91     | 99      | 116     |
    ## Balances of the trader accounts reflect the change, total adds up to 1070 -> trader3 lost money
    ## as expected, but was able to close their position
    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | trader3 | ETH   | ETH/DEC20 | 99     | 971     |
