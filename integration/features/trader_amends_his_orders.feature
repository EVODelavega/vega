Feature: Trader amends his orders

  Background:

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator                  | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | oracle config          |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC        | BTC   | default-simple-risk-model-2 | default-overkill-margin-calculator | 1                | default-none | default-none     | default-eth-for-future |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |
    And the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |

  Scenario: Amend rejected for non existing order
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader | asset | amount |
      | myboi  | BTC   | 10000  |
      | aux    | BTC   | 100000 |
      | aux2   | BTC   | 100000 |

    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 1     | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 2     | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    And the traders place the following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference   |
      | myboi  | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 2     | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | myboi-ref-1 |

# cancel the order, so we cannot edit it.
    And the traders cancel the following orders:
      | trader | reference   |
      | myboi  | myboi-ref-1 |
    And the traders amend the following orders:
      | trader | reference   | price | size delta | tif     |
      | myboi  | myboi-ref-1 | 2     | 3          | TIF_GTC |
    But the following amendments should be rejected:
