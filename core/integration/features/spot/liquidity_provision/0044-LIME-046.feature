    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks

    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 15    | 1    | party2 |

    Then the market data for the market "BTC/ETH" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | auction trigger             | target stake | supplied stake | open interest |
      | 15         | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | AUCTION_TRIGGER_UNSPECIFIED | 2400         | 3000           | 0             |

    Then the network moves ahead "5" blocks
    And the network treasury balance should be "1800" for the asset "ETH"
    Then the party "lp1" lp liquidity bond account balance should be "1200" for the market "BTC/ETH"
