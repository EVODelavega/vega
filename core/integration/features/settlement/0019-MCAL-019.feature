Feature: Test mark to market settlement with periodicity, takes the first scenario from mark_to_market_settlement_neg_pdp

  Background:

    And the perpetual oracles from "0xCAFECAFE1":
      | name        | asset | settlement property | settlement type | schedule property | schedule type  | margin funding factor | interest rate | clamp lower bound | clamp upper bound | quote name | settlement decimals |
      | perp-oracle | ETH | perp.ETH.value | TYPE_INTEGER | perp.funding.cue | TYPE_TIMESTAMP | 0.5 | 0.05 | 0 | 0 | ETH | 18 |
    And the liquidity sla params named "SLA":
      | price range | commitment min time fraction | performance hysteresis epochs | sla competition factor |
      | 1.0         | 0.5                          | 1                             | 1.0                    |

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | position decimal places | market type | sla params |
      | ETH/DEC19 | ETH        | ETH   | default-simple-risk-model-3 | default-margin-calculator | 1                | default-none | default-none     | perp-oracle        | 1e6                    | 1e6                         | -3                       | perp        | default-futures |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |
      | limits.markets.maxPeggedOrders | 2     |

  @Perpetual
  Scenario: 0019-MCAL-019 Mark to market settlement works correctly with margin funding factor and interest rate
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 5s    |
    And the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount    |
      | party1 | ETH   | 10000000  |
      | party2 | ETH   | 10000000  |
      | party3 | ETH   | 10000000  |
      | aux    | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | aux2   | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | lpprov | ETH   | 100000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 10000000          | 0.001 | submission |
      | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 10000000          | 0.001 | submission |
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party  | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume     | offset |
      | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 2         | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 50         | 1      |
      | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 2         | 1                    | sell | ASK              | 50         | 1      |
 
    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | aux   | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 49    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

      | aux2  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux   | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/DEC19" should be:
      | target stake | supplied stake |
      | 1100000      | 10000000       |
    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the settlement account should have a balance of "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    # back sure we end the block so we're in a new one after opening auction
    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    When the parties place the following orders:

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party  | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | party1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 120000 | 9880000 |
      | party2 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 132000 | 9867000 |
