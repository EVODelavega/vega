Feature: Check penalties for early exit

# For a market with market.liquidity.earlyExitPenalty = 0.25 and 
# total stake = target stake + 40 already, a liquidity provider who reduces their
# commitment by 100 will receive a total of 85 back into their general account
# with 15 transferred into the market's insurance account (40 received without penalty,
# then the remaining 60 receiving a 25% penalty). (0044-LIME-024)

   When the network moves ahead "1" blocks
   Then the liquidity provisions should have the following states:
     | id  | party  | market    | commitment amount | status           |
     | lp1 | party1 | ETH/DEC21 | 1040              | STATUS_ACTIVE    |

   # Now the party try to reduce their commitment
