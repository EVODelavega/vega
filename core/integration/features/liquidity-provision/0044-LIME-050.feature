    Given the average block duration is "1"
  @Now
  Scenario: 001: lp1 and lp2 on the market ETH/MAR22 placed commitment during opening auction, 0044-LIME-050
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount |
      | lp1    | USD   | 100000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 100000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 100000 |
      | party2 | USD   | 100000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 100000 |

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 4000              | 0.02  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 4000              | 0.015 | submission |
    And the supplied stake should be "8000" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
    When the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type   |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 6000              | 0.02  | amendment |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 6000              | 0.015 | amendment |
    #When a LP increases their commitment then: It takes effect immediately for the purposes of LP stake supplied to the market
    And the supplied stake should be "12000" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
    When the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
    And the current epoch is "0"

    #lp place pegged order end of first epoch
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume | offset | reference |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 12        | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 12     | 20     | lp-b-1    |

    When the network moves ahead "5" blocks
    And the current epoch is "1"

    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 10     | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 10     | 1100  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
    And the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 1000  | 1    | party2 |

    When the network moves ahead "6" blocks
    And the current epoch is "1"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
    And the supplied stake should be "12000" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    When the network moves ahead "6" blocks
    And the current epoch is "2"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "3600" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
    And the supplied stake should be "8400" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    Then the following transfers should happen:
      | from | to     | from account      | to account             | market id | amount | asset |
      | lp2  | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_BOND | ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE | ETH/MAR22 | 3600   | USD   |
