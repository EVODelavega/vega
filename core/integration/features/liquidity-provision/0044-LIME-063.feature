    Given the average block duration is "1"
  @Now
  Scenario: 001: lp1 and lp2 on the market ETH/MAR22, 0044-LIME-063, 0044-LIME-079, 0044-LIME-081, 0044-LIME-101
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount |
      | lp1    | USD   | 100000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 100000 |

      | party2 | USD   | 100000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 100000 |

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 6000              | 0.02  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 4000              | 0.015 | submission |

    When the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the current epoch is "0"
    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 10     | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |
