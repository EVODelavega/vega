    When the network moves ahead "1" epochs
    Then parties should have the following vesting account balances:

    # Move party2 to team2, the nop should now force a 5 way split of the fee
    When the parties apply the following referral codes:
      | party  | code            | is_team | team  |
      | party2 | referral-code-2 | true    | team2 |
    Then the team "team2" has the following members:
      | party     |
      | referrer2 |
      | ref2-0001 |
      | ref2-0002 |
      | party2    |
    ## Division as follows:
    # Team1: 5k each from transfer only applicable to them = 8333 + 5000 = 13333
    #       10k split equally across team1 and 2 = 2.5k each = 13333 + 2500 = 15833
    # Team2: 5k split 3 ways == 1666 each: ref2-0001 and ref2-0002 = 1666 + 1666 == 3333
    #       party2 gets 7777 + 1666 = 9443.66666 â‰ƒ 9444
