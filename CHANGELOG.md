# Changelog

## 0.23.1

*2020-08-27*

This release backports a fix from the forthcoming 0.24.0 release that fixes a GraphQL issue with the new `Asset` type. When fetching the Assets from the top level, all the details came through. When fetching them as a nested property, only the ID was filled in. This is now fixed.

## Improvements

- [#2140](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2140) GraphQL fix for fetching assets as nested properties

## 0.23.0

*2020-08-10*

This release contains a lot of groundwork for Fees and Auction mode.

**Fees** are incurred on every trade on Vega. Those fees are divided between up to three recipient types, but traders will only see one collective fee charged. The fees reward liquidity providers, infrastructure providers and market makers.

* The liquidity portion of the fee is paid to market makers for providing liquidity, and is transferred to the market-maker fee pool for the market.
* The infrastructure portion of the fee, which is paid to validators as a reward for running the infrastructure of the network, is transferred to the infrastructure fee pool for that asset. It is then periodically distributed to the validators.
* The maker portion of the fee is transferred to the non-aggressive, or passive party in the trade (the maker, as opposed to the taker).

**Auction mode** is not enabled in this release, but the work is nearly complete for Opening Auctions on new markets.

ðŸ’¥ Please note, **this release disables order amends**. The team uncovered an issue in the Market Depth API output that is caused by order amends, so rather than give incorrect output, we've temporarily disabled the amendment of orders. They will return when the Market Depth API is fixed. For now, *amends will return an error*.

### Bugfixes
- [#2096](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2096) Fix concurrent map access in event forward

*2020-07-20*

This release primarily focuses on setting up Vega nodes to deal correctly with events sourced from other chains, working towards bridging assets from Ethereum. This includes responding to asset events from Ethereum, and support for validator nodes notarising asset movements and proposals.

It also contains a lot of bug fixes and improvements, primarily around an internal refactor to using an event bus to communicate between packages. Also included are some corrections for order statuses that were incorrectly being reported or left outdated on the APIs.
